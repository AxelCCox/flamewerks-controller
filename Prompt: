I am working on an ESP32-C6-based remote burner control system for farm use. The project is called "FlameWerks Remote Burner Control System" and uses WiFi for web-based control, QR code provisioning, and safety features. The hardware controls pilot and main gas valves, an igniter, and flame sensing via ADC. The code includes a web server, state machine, safety logic, and a PWA interface.

What I need help with:

Troubleshooting why my ESP32-C6 board is not connecting or uploading in Arduino IDE (it gets stuck at "Compiling sketch...").
Reviewing my code for any issues that could prevent successful upload or operation.
Suggestions for improving reliability, WiFi provisioning, or burner safety logic.
Any advice for debugging ESP32-C6 hardware connectivity on Windows.
My code is attached. Please provide step-by-step guidance and recommendations.
